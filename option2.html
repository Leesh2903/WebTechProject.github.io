        <p> You leave your house, you live close to the edge of town and you remember there being a small security base close by. Heading for that, hidden in the night you run in. In the pitch dark room you stagger into
            a table making a loud noise. The building was seemingly empty however the noise seems to have alerted some nearby guards.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p> You notice a small cabinet nearby you can either...</p>
        <p>OPTION 1: Listen as they walk into the room until they seem distracted enough to try sneak out and away through the way you came in.</p>
        <p>OPTION 2: Wait it out silently behind the cabinet as the guards look around. </p>
