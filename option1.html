        <p>Your town's water supply has been contaminated by some sort of infection. Nearly everyone is suffering, some are even dead already. You are yet to suffer, luckily enough 
           to have not been infected. Your towns been placed in a high security lockdown with groups of armed guards at all routes in and out. You must make your escape...
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>It's late in the afternoon, 9 days into the lockdown do you...</p>
        <p>OPTION 1: Decide to stay and try drink small amounts of water, staying shut in your house alone. Who knows? Maybe building up a resistance is a possibility.</p>
        <p>OPTION 2: Make a plan to leave town, flee and try to get to the rumoured town said to be creating a cure, taking routes and risks into consideration. </p>
