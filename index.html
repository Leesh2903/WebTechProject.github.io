    <p> The town you live in has been contaminated with a form of unknown poison, the oxygen and water within the town has become too polluted to sustain life within 
        the area. Nearly everyone in the town has been noted to begin suffering in some way, some have even been discovered dead within their homes. You however are 
        yet to show any form of suffering luckily, perhaps you are not infected yet with the unknown poison. Your town has also been placed within a high security lockdown with groups of armed guards at all possible escape points, you must 
        escape at all cost to try avoiding the infection.
